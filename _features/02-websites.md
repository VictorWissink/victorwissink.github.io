### [joshhendriks.com](https://www.joshhendriks.com)
A website for a music producer and mixing engineer. Here I applied lots of animations to give the website a dynamic feel.  

### [yoriyoi.shop](https://www.yoriyoi.shop)
This is a website for a start-up clothing brand. The interface is divided in cards, which are easily scale-able thanks to css grid.

On this project, simplicity was key to make the artworks speak for themselves. The main purpose is getting potential clients to request an inquiry for specific paintings.
