Currently I am working as an Engineer in Test for Wire. Here I am mainly responsible for maintaining and automating for the iOS platform, and guiding Junior QA Engineers to improve their skills. Apart from that, I also maintain and automate for Android and Web, using Appium and Selenium Webdriver Agent. I'm also always looking for improvements to help our team function better.
