As the Team Lead QA Engineer at Wire, I set the vision, delegate tasks, and ensure our iOS platform's automation and maintenance. My responsibilities also extend to mentoring junior QA engineers, helping them grow their skills. Our tech stack includes Appium, Selenium Webdriver Agent, Jenkins, and Java. I'm passionate about identifying and implementing improvements for our team's efficiency.
