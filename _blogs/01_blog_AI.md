## ChatGPT: A Game Changer
OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) has transformed the AI landscape, making an enormous impact with its capabilities as a large language model. While most people have a fair understanding of what it does, I'd like to explore some functionalities that expand upon its core abilities and how I personally exploit these to optimize my work.

### Make AI read web pages
ChatGPT doesn't browse the web by default, but by opting for the plus subscription, this becomes possible. Alternatively, [Bing Chat](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat), available on Microsoft Edge, offers a similar performance and even allows web crawling. Bing Chat operates on GPT 3.5, a middle ground between GPT 3 and GPT 4, and provides useful research capabilities.

### Plugins and the Power of Personalization
ChatGPT Plus comes with plugins that can conduct research for you, similair to Bing Chat, but with the added power of GPT-4. This opens the door to intriguing use cases. For example, you might be wondering about things to do in a city you're visiting. With certain parameters such as the dates of your visit, your budget, preferences, and desired ratings on Google Maps, the tool can generate a personalized itinerary for you.

### Getting the Most out of ChatGPT
ChatGPT, particularly when powered by GPT-4, is undeniably a powerhouse. However, to leverage its full potential, certain strategies can be employed. A few tricks I've found helpful include prompting the AI to "be concise", asking it to "write like a native speaker", complimenting it to enhance its output, and even training it within the session. By giving examples of the output you desire, you can train ChatGPT to match your expectations more closely.

## Transcribing and Structuring Your Thoughts
[MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) is another valuable tool I regularly use. It transcribes your audio recordings and wil soon be able to provide live transcriptions, ensuring every word said in a meeting is recorded and shared easily. [Audiopen](https://audiopen.ai), albeit a more costly alternative, can transform your ramblings into a clear, structured document.

However, you can achieve similar results with MacWhisper, which is built on OpenAI's Whisper. The trick is understanding the prompt that Audiopen sends to GPT: "The original text needs to be restructured and condensed by approximately 50% while maintaining its content. The goal is to create a clear, concise narrative with logically coherent sentences that flow smoothly. Additionally, appropriate paragraph breaks should be incorporated for easy understanding and readability."

## From Text to Podcast and Beyond
[ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io) takes the capabilities of these tools even further. This AI speech software sounds natural and can even emulate breathing and thinking pauses. This level of natural sounding language allows you to create podcasts based on automated content curation. Dutch Digital creator Frank Nanninga has utilized this to create [a daily podcast](https://beyondthescreen.transistor.fm) with minimal interaction on his part.

## Assisting Document Writing and Code Completion
For writing documents, AI can also lend a hand. While ChatGPT can help gather data and structure it, tools like [Lex.Page](https://lex.page), powered by GPT, can act as an AI editor, suggesting improvements and generating summaries, conclusions, or even titles. For coders, [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is a fantastic aid, suggesting code to complete your tasks based on the context of your project, making it a valuable tool in the developer world.


In conclusion, the world of AI offers a myriad of tools to assist and optimize your workflow. While I've touched upon some of the ways I use AI in my work, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The potential for AI to revolutionize our work is immense, and I hope you find these insights helpful in navigating this exciting realm. What's your take on AI tools transforming our workflow?
